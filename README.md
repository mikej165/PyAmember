# PyAmember #

Python/SQLAlchemy db mappings for the Amember membership management system. These are for Amember 3.2.3PRO and will probably work with some earlier versions. They will not, however, work with the newer 4.x versions recently released.

TODO: Only a handful of the schema relationships have been defined (the ones I needed). To make fullest use of this, it will be necessary for you to define them yourself.
